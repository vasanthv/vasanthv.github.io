    <title>Attachment is the Root of All Suffering</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all know about the Buddhist philosophy that attachment is the root of all suffering. While this idea is often applied broadly—to relationships, possessions, or desires—I want to explore a very specific type of attachment today: attachment to the self-image we hold of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us carries a mental picture of who we are. This self-image could be shaped by our upbringing, achievements, failures, or the roles we play in life. It is the story we tell ourselves about ourselves. On the surface, having a self-image seems harmless, even necessary. It helps us navigate the world with a sense of identity. But what happens when we become overly attached to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Burden of Protecting Self-Image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are too attached to our self-image, we start to guard it fiercely. Every comment, action, or situation that seems to challenge it can feel like a personal attack. This attachment often manifests as stress and anxiety, as we feel compelled to uphold and defend the version of ourselves we believe to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if your self-image is that of a competent professional, a single mistake at work might feel devastating. You might replay the scenario in your head, overanalyzing what others think of you. Similarly, if you see yourself as a kind and generous person, any criticism suggesting otherwise can feel like a deep wound. This incessant need to protect your self-image can make you overly sensitive and reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taking Things Personally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest signs of attachment to self-image is taking things personally. A critical remark, a disagreement, or even someone else’s bad mood can feel like a direct assault on your character. The reality, however, is that most of these situations have little to do with you as a person. But when your self-image is on the line, it’s easy to lose perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone points out a flaw in your work, your attachment to being “perfect” might cause you to feel hurt or defensive. Instead of viewing the feedback as an opportunity to grow, you may see it as a threat to your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let It Go&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we free ourselves from this attachment to self-image? The first step is awareness. Recognize when your self-image is at play and notice how it influences your thoughts and emotions. Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does this bother me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What am I trying to protect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this worth my peace of mind?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practicing mindfulness can help you observe these patterns without judgment. Over time, you may realize that your self-image is just one aspect of who you are, not the entirety of your being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also helpful to embrace impermanence and flexibility. Just as people and circumstances change, so can your self-image. Instead of clinging to a fixed version of yourself, allow it to evolve naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you release your attachment to self-image, you open the door to freedom. You’re no longer burdened by the need to prove yourself or maintain a facade. Instead, you can focus on living authentically, learning from experiences, and connecting with others without fear or pretense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist teaching reminds us that attachment leads to suffering. By letting go of the attachment to our self-image, we can lighten the emotional load we carry and create space for greater peace and self-acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I Built Unfeed</title>
    <link href="https://vasanthv.me/posts/why-i-built-unfeed/" />
    <updated>2024-12-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://vasanthv.me/posts/why-i-built-unfeed/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an age where information flows faster than ever, keeping up with content that truly matters can feel overwhelming. Social media platforms curate content with algorithms that often prioritize engagement over value, leading to an endless scroll of distractions. This chaos inspired me to rethink how I consume content, and that’s where the idea for &lt;a href=&quot;https://unfeed.net&quot;&gt;Unfeed&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Personal Need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who values intentional living and minimalism, I wanted a tool that would simplify my content consumption. I needed something straightforward—a single chronological feed where I could catch up on updates from my favorite websites and blogs without the noise of social media. The existing RSS readers either felt overly complex or didn’t align with my needs, so I decided to build something for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus on the Essentials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfeed is my attempt to bring clarity to content consumption. At its core, it does two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronological Feed&lt;/strong&gt;: It presents content in the order it was published, respecting the timeline rather than manipulating it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmarking&lt;/strong&gt;: It allows users to save articles they want to revisit, without cluttering their feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. No categories, no recommendations, no distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building for Real Users (Including Myself)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been passionate about creating products that solve real problems, and it’s even more fulfilling when I’m a user of my own creation. With Unfeed, every design choice is intentional, focusing on simplicity and utility. Whether it’s automatically discovering RSS feeds from a website URL or ensuring that items stay available for 10 days after they’re removed from the source feed, every feature serves a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning. As I continue refining Unfeed, I’m excited to see how it evolves with feedback from its users. Whether you’re someone who cherishes simplicity or just wants a break from algorithm-driven feeds, I hope Unfeed becomes a tool you’ll love as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I built Unfeed for those who seek a quieter, more intentional way to stay informed. If that resonates with you, I invite you to give it a try and share your thoughts. Together, we can shape a tool that helps us focus on what truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Power of &quot;It&#39;s alright&quot;</title>
    <link href="https://vasanthv.me/posts/power-of-its-alright/" />
    <updated>2024-12-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://vasanthv.me/posts/power-of-its-alright/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our fast-paced, hyperconnected world, misunderstandings and mistakes are inevitable. It could be a friend running late, a colleague missing a deadline, or a stranger bumping into you on the street. In these moments, a simple phrase has the power to diffuse tension, foster understanding, and build bridges: “It’s alright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While seemingly ordinary, these two words carry profound meaning. They convey acceptance, forgiveness, and empathy—qualities that are often in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fostering Emotional Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone apologizes, their vulnerability is on display. Responding with “It’s alright” acknowledges their effort to make amends. It shows that you value the relationship more than the mistake. This small act of grace can deepen emotional bonds, creating an environment where people feel safe to be imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diffusing Tension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stressful situations, tempers can flare. Imagine being stuck in traffic when another driver accidentally cuts you off. Reacting with anger escalates the situation, while a mindset of “It’s alright” helps you stay calm and move forward. This approach reduces stress—not just for others, but for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practicing Self-Compassion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “It’s alright” isn’t limited to interactions with others; it’s equally vital for yourself. We all have moments where we fall short of our expectations. Instead of harsh self-criticism, offer yourself the same kindness you would extend to a friend. Remind yourself that mistakes don’t define you—they’re simply part of being human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, “It’s alright” doesn’t mean condoning harmful behavior or ignoring serious issues. It’s about letting go of the small stuff, choosing kindness over criticism, and recognizing that everyone is doing their best with the tools they have. The next time life throws you a curveball, or someone seeks your forgiveness, pause and consider saying, “It’s alright.” You might be surprised at the warmth and connection it brings—not just to others, but to yourself. In a world that often feels harsh, these two words can be a powerful act of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hello World!</title>
    <link href="https://vasanthv.me/posts/hello-world/" />
    <updated>2024-12-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://vasanthv.me/posts/hello-world/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, and welcome to my blog! Starting a blog has been on my mind for a while now, and I’ve finally decided to take the leap. This isn’t my first attempt at blogging—I actually started my first blog 13 years ago. Back then, it was more of a tech-focused blog with very little actual writing, and, as you might guess, it didn’t last long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time feels different. I’m determined to keep it going and make writing a regular part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will I be writing about?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t have a specific theme or focus right now. It’s probably going to be a little bit of everything—my projects, my career, the movies I watch, or whatever else feels worth sharing. So, if it feels like things are all over the place, well, that’s just how it’s going to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you’ll stick around for the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
