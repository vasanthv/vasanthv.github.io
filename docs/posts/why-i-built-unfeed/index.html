				<time datetime="2024-12-11T00:00:00.000Z" class="light">December 11, 2024</time>
				<p>In an age where information flows faster than ever, keeping up with content that truly matters can feel overwhelming. Social media platforms curate content with algorithms that often prioritize engagement over value, leading to an endless scroll of distractions. This chaos inspired me to rethink how I consume content, and that’s where the idea for <a href="https://unfeed.net">Unfeed</a> was born.</p>
<h3>A Personal Need</h3>
<p>As someone who values intentional living and minimalism, I wanted a tool that would simplify my content consumption. I needed something straightforward—a single chronological feed where I could catch up on updates from my favorite websites and blogs without the noise of social media. The existing RSS readers either felt overly complex or didn’t align with my needs, so I decided to build something for myself.</p>
<h3>Focus on the Essentials</h3>
<p>Unfeed is my attempt to bring clarity to content consumption. At its core, it does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chronological Feed</strong>: It presents content in the order it was published, respecting the timeline rather than manipulating it.</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarking</strong>: It allows users to save articles they want to revisit, without cluttering their feed.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. No categories, no recommendations, no distractions.</p>
<h3>Building for Real Users (Including Myself)</h3>
<p>I’ve always been passionate about creating products that solve real problems, and it’s even more fulfilling when I’m a user of my own creation. With Unfeed, every design choice is intentional, focusing on simplicity and utility. Whether it’s automatically discovering RSS feeds from a website URL or ensuring that items stay available for 10 days after they’re removed from the source feed, every feature serves a purpose.</p>
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>This is just the beginning. As I continue refining Unfeed, I’m excited to see how it evolves with feedback from its users. Whether you’re someone who cherishes simplicity or just wants a break from algorithm-driven feeds, I hope Unfeed becomes a tool you’ll love as much as I do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I built Unfeed for those who seek a quieter, more intentional way to stay informed. If that resonates with you, I invite you to give it a try and share your thoughts. Together, we can shape a tool that helps us focus on what truly matters.</p>
