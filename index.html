					Hi, I'm <strong class="colored">Vasanth V</strong>, a Frontend Engineer based in Barrie, Canada,
					with a passion for blending design and code.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've had the opportunity to work at both big tech companies and early-stage startups, gaining a
					broad understanding of the full stack, from UI/UX design to backend APIs and databases. While my
					focus is on frontend development, my go-to tech stack includes Node.js, Vue.js (or React.js), and
					MongoDB.
				</p>

				<p>
					Currently, I work at Amazon as a Frontend Engineer. In my spare time, I enjoy working on side
					projects like <a href="https://webtag.io" style="color: #f22952" target="_blank">Webtag</a>,
					<a href="https://overtalk.io" style="color: #000" target="_blank">Overtalk</a>, and
					<a href="https://vasanthv.me/looptap/" style="color: #ed5565" target="_blank">Looptap</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me watching movies,
					<a href="https://www.chess.com/member/vsnthv" style="color: #5e9a48" target="_blank"
						>playing chess</a
					>, or spending time with my wonderful family.
