### Work

By day, I’m a staff developer at Quadient, where I spend my time designing systems, solving interesting problems, and occasionally arguing with code until it finally agrees with me.

### Side project

Outside of work, I’m experimenting with a side project: a social app that brings people together in small, 10-person discussion groups. [https://veenew.com](https://veenew.com)
