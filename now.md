### Work

By day, I’m a staff developer at Quadient, where I spend my time designing systems, solving interesting problems, and occasionally arguing with code until it finally agrees with me.

### Side project

Outside of work, I’m tinkering with a side project I’m pretty excited about, a new kind of social app focused on helping people make online friends who genuinely match their vibe. Less chaos, more real connections, and zero pressure to be anyone other than yourself.
