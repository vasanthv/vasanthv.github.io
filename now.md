### Work

By day, I’m a staff developer at Quadient, where I spend my time designing systems, solving interesting problems, and occasionally arguing with code until it finally agrees with me.

### Side project

Outside of work, I’m tinkering with a side project: a simple, free RSS reader app that lets anyone follow any feed. It mostly came from trying to solve my own problem. [https://veread.com](https://veread.com)
