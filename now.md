### Work

I’m currently working full-time at **Amazon** a front-end engineer.

In my spare time, I’m dedicated to improving **Unfeed**, a minimalist RSS feed aggregator and bookmarking app. My goal is to make Unfeed as intuitive and useful as possible, focusing on features that prioritize simplicity and a clean user experience.

### What’s Next

- Iterating on Unfeed based on user feedback.
- Balancing full-time work with my passion for building products in my spare time.
