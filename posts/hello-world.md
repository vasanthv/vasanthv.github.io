Hi everyone, and welcome to my blog! Starting a blog has been on my mind for a while now, and I’ve finally decided to take the leap. This isn’t my first attempt at blogging—I actually started my first blog 13 years ago. Back then, it was more of a tech-focused blog with very little actual writing, and, as you might guess, it didn’t last long.

But this time feels different. I’m determined to keep it going and make writing a regular part of my life.

### What will I be writing about?

Honestly, I don’t have a specific theme or focus right now. It’s probably going to be a little bit of everything—my projects, my career, the movies I watch, or whatever else feels worth sharing. So, if it feels like things are all over the place, well, that’s just how it’s going to be!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you’ll stick around for the journey.
